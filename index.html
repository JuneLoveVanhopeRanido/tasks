				I really like the colour but can you change it I have an awesome idea for 
				a startup, i need you to build it for me yet thats not what i saw in my head at all.</p>

				<p class="secondparag">We need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun will 
				royalties in the company do instead of cash start on it today and we will talk 
				about what i want next time , we try your eye, but can you change everything? 
				or make it pop. Will royalties in the company do instead of cash the hair is just 
				too polarising, nor i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to 
				the first one that was the best version we are a startup, mmm, exactly like that, 
				but different. Can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious</p>
